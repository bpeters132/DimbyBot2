# Implementation Plan: Add Performance Monitoring and Profiling Tools

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Establish performance observability for both local development and production by instrumenting the Discord bot and Lavalink services with metrics, profiling, and alerting.
- Provide developers with lightweight profiling workflows to diagnose latency or resource regressions before deployment, while ensuring production dashboards capture real-time health signals.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Instrument core bot flows to emit latency, throughput, and error metrics with ≤5% runtime overhead in production.
- Deliver dashboards and alert rules that detect latency spikes (>20% over baseline) or resource saturation within five minutes of occurrence.
- Ensure every release undergoes at least one automated profiling smoke test validating CPU and memory baselines against prior versions.
- Provide developers with a scripted local profiling workflow that can be executed end-to-end in under 10 minutes.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Observability Requirements & Baseline Audit**
   - Inventory existing logs and diagnostics in [`src/lib/Logger.js`](src/lib/Logger.js:1), [`src/events/lavaManagerEvents.js`](src/events/lavaManagerEvents.js:1), and [`src/events/lavaNodeEvents.js`](src/events/lavaNodeEvents.js:1).
   - Define KPI metrics for both environments: command latency, queue processing time, Lavalink node health, CPU/memory footprint, and Discord API rate usage.
   - Document target thresholds and consumers (developers, on-call rotation) in the plan’s appendix.

2. **Metrics Instrumentation (Bot)**
   - Introduce a metrics layer at [`src/config/environment.js`](src/config/environment.js) (from Recommendation O) to configure exporters per environment.
   - Add `prom-client` for production metrics and `prometheus-api-metrics` or lightweight middleware for development introspection.
   - Instrument key code paths:
     - Slash command execution (e.g., [`src/commands/music/Play.js`](src/commands/music/Play.js:1)) for response latency and success/failure counters.
     - Queue management utilities in [`src/util/musicManager.js`](src/util/musicManager.js:1) for track lookup durations and fallback usage.
     - Lavalink connection handlers for reconnection frequency and node assignment.

3. **Lavalink Metrics & Aggregation**
   - Enable Lavalink’s built-in Prometheus endpoint in [`Lavalink/application.yml`](Lavalink/application.yml) (or create override) with authentication.
   - Extend docker-compose files (`docker-compose.yml`, [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](docker-compose.dev.yml:1)) to expose metrics ports (local only) and secure production access via internal network.
   - Update [`lavaNodesConfig.js`](lavaNodesConfig.js:1) to include metadata for node IDs referenced in metrics.

4. **Profiling Toolchain (Local Development)**
   - Add profiling scripts (`yarn profile:cpu`, `yarn profile:heap`) utilizing `clinic.js` or `node --inspect --prof` with automated result exports.
   - Document workflow in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/suggestions/perf-profiling-guide.md` if deeper walkthrough needed) showing how to interpret flamegraphs and heap snapshots.
   - Integrate profiling toggles into [`dev-env.sh`](dev-env.sh:1) (e.g., `./dev-env.sh profile`) to run targeted workloads against local Lavalink.

5. **Monitoring Stack Integration (Production)**
   - Provision Prometheus scraper configuration referencing bot and Lavalink endpoints; store configuration under `infra/` or DevOps repository.
   - Create Grafana dashboards highlighting command performance, Lavalink node health, and resource usage; export JSON to `docs/monitoring/` for version control.
   - Define alert rules (Prometheus Alertmanager or Grafana) for latency anomalies, crash loops, and missing heartbeats.

6. **Governance, Documentation, and Rollout**
   - Update README and deployment runbooks with monitoring setup steps, dashboard links, and alert response playbook.
   - Add onboarding checklist items requiring developers to run local profiling and understand dashboard navigation.
   - Schedule knowledge-sharing session with DevOps and developer leads to agree on on-call expectations.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Prometheus & Grafana instances (self-hosted or managed), `prom-client` npm package, profiling tools (Clinic.js), storage for dashboards/runbooks.
- **Dependencies:** Environment configuration layering from [`docs/suggestions/environment-specific-configs.md`](docs/suggestions/environment-specific-configs.md), upcoming CI enhancements in [`docs/suggestions/cicd-code-quality-checks.md`](docs/suggestions/cicd-code-quality-checks.md), and Lavalink deployment pipelines.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (instrumentation), DevOps/Infrastructure (monitoring stack, secret management), QA/Release (baseline profiling in release checklist), Site reliability/on-call leads (alert ownership).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~3 engineering days plus coordination.
  1. Day 1: Requirements workshop, instrumentation scaffolding, Prometheus endpoint configuration.
  2. Day 2: Dashboard/alert setup, local profiling scripts, integration with docker-compose.
  3. Day 3: Documentation, onboarding materials, dry-run profiling session, stakeholder review.
- Schedule after hot module reloading (Recommendation P) and before advanced queue visualization (Recommendation S) so upcoming UX work benefits from improved monitoring.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Runtime Overhead or Memory Leaks:** Profile dev builds with metrics enabled, using feature flags to disable collectors if regressions detected.
- **Sensitive Data in Metrics:** Sanitize labels (no user IDs), enforce allowlist for exported dimensions, and review with security.
- **Monitoring Stack Drift:** Automate dashboard provisioning via IaC and review monthly; include check in release checklist.
- **Alert Fatigue:** Start with minimal critical alerts, iterate after observing production behavior, and adopt on-call feedback loop.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Add tests validating metrics registration and exporter health endpoints (mock Prometheus client).
- **Local Profiling Validation:** Run scripted workloads with `yarn profile:cpu` and verify flamegraph artifacts stored under `profiles/` for analysis.
- **Staging Soak Tests:** Deploy instrumentation to staging, simulate load (music queue playback) for one hour, and confirm dashboards/alerts behave as expected.
- **Production Smoke Checks:** After rollout, verify Prometheus scrapes succeed and dashboards populate within five minutes; monitor for false positives during the first week.
