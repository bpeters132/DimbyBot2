# Implementation Plan: Add Health Checks and Rollback Capabilities

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Augment the production deployment flow with automated health checks and managed rollback procedures aligned with the new blue-green strategy.
- Introduce application-level and infrastructure-level probes covering bot connectivity, Lavalink availability, and supporting services.
- Provide tooling and documentation so operators can trigger and monitor rollbacks within the GitHub Actions-driven deployment pipeline.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Detect regressions within two minutes of deploying to the inactive (blue/green) environment through automated health checks, preventing promotion of unhealthy releases.
- Achieve successful automated rollback of failed deploys with an RTO of ≤10 minutes and document each rollback event.
- Maintain zero false positives over five consecutive releases by calibrating health thresholds and suppressing transient noise.
- Provide actionable observability: consolidated dashboards or logs summarizing health status before and after cutover.

## 3. Technical Approach and Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Define health criteria and instrumentation**
   - Identify critical signals: Discord gateway connectivity, command latency, Lavalink node health, queue processing, and process-level metrics.
   - Extend the bot to expose lightweight health endpoints (e.g., `/healthz` via an HTTP server or Discord heartbeat metrics) or CLI diagnostics triggered by deployment scripts.
   - Instrument Lavalink and ancillary services with readiness probes or scriptable checks.

2. **Implement automated health checks**
   - Create scripts invoked by the GitHub Actions deploy job that run against the inactive color environment (Recommendation H) post-deploy but pre-cutover.
   - Checks should include:
     - Bot login and slash-command smoke tests using a staging guild.
     - Lavalink REST ping and voice channel join/leave simulation.
     - Log inspection for errors over a defined window.
   - Store results as artifacts and gate promotion on pass/fail status.

3. **Integrate rollback logic**
   - Extend deployment orchestration (remote `ci_deploy.sh`) to record the active color, commit SHA, and timestamp before cutover.
   - Implement rollback script (`ci_rollback.sh`) that:
     - Stops the unhealthy environment.
     - Reactivates the previous color using stored metadata.
     - Optionally rolls back database or configuration changes.
   - Wire the rollback script into GitHub Actions via manual `workflow_dispatch` or automated trigger upon health-check failure.

4. **Enhance observability**
   - Configure centralized logging (e.g., Loki, ELK, or at minimum structured logs) tagging entries with environment color.
  - Define dashboards/alerts (Grafana, Discord webhooks, or GitHub summary) that highlight post-deploy error rates, command failures, and Lavalink connectivity.
   - Publish summary reports after each deploy containing health-check results and active color.

5. **Testing and rehearsal**
   - Create staging rehearsal playbook: run full deployment, intentionally inject faults (e.g., kill Lavalink, break bot token) to validate detection and rollback response.
   - Automate chaos-style scripts for future validation cycles.

6. **Documentation and runbooks**
   - Update operational runbooks detailing:
     - Health-check coverage, thresholds, and manual execution instructions.
     - Rollback invocation steps and fallback procedures when automation fails.
   - Provide quick-reference checklist for on-call engineers.

7. **Governance and continuous improvement**
   - Establish cadence for reviewing health-check efficacy (every sprint) and update thresholds as system behavior evolves.
   - Collect post-mortems on rollback events to refine scripts and documentation.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Access to production/staging servers, ability to modify GitHub Actions workflows and remote scripts, monitoring stack (or plan to implement one).
- **Dependencies:** Completion of Recommendation H (blue-green deployment), optimized images from Recommendations E–G to ensure fast redeploys, staging guild for automated command tests.
- **Stakeholders:** DevOps/infra (script automation, monitoring), backend engineers (health endpoints), QA (test scenarios), on-call/operations teams (runbooks and training).

## 5. Timeline and Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 3 engineering days plus coordination.
  1. Day 1: Define health metrics, implement instrumentation in bot/Lavalink.
  2. Day 2: Integrate checks into deployment pipeline, develop rollback scripts.
  3. Day 3: Observability dashboards, rehearsal drills, documentation.
  4. Buffer for tuning thresholds and handling initial rollout feedback.
- Execute immediately after Recommendation H to leverage the blue-green infrastructure for safe validation.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **False positives/negatives:** Start with conservative thresholds and allow manual override; iterate after observing production behavior.
- **Rollback failure modes:** Maintain manual SSH-based procedure as fallback and document required credentials/access.
- **State drift:** Ensure configuration and data migrations are idempotent or include reverse steps; consider database snapshots before cutover.
- **Operational overhead:** Automate status reporting and provide minimal-touch interfaces (e.g., GitHub comments or Slack notifications) to reduce manual steps.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Automated tests:** Unit/integration tests for health-check components; mock Discord/Lavalink interactions where direct testing is impractical.
- **Staging rehearsals:** Perform end-to-end deploy, trigger induced failure, and verify automated rollback completes successfully.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Track health-check execution times, failure rates, and rollback outcomes in deployment summaries.
- **Post-deploy audits:** Review metrics and logs after each release to confirm stability; adjust scripts if issues recur.
