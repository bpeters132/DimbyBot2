# Implementation Plan: Add Code Quality Checks to CI/CD

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Integrate linting, formatting, and static analysis steps into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce consistent code quality before builds and deployments.
- Extend local developer tooling so contributors can run identical quality checks pre-commit, reducing friction between local and CI workflows.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Ensure every pull request executes linting and formatting checks automatically with clear pass/fail statuses.
- Reduce style-related review feedback by ≥80% within two sprints post-implementation.
- Guarantee CI quality checks complete in < 5 minutes with actionable failure messages.
- Achieve 100% adoption of local pre-flight commands (e.g., via documented `make lint`) among active contributors.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Tooling Inventory & Gap Analysis**
   - Confirm existing ESLint/Prettier configurations (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`) meet project standards.
   - Identify additional linters if needed (e.g., markdownlint for docs, editorconfig-checker).
2. **Local Command Enhancements**
   - Add package scripts: `yarn lint`, `yarn format`, `yarn lint:fix`.
   - Update Makefile and `dev-env.sh` with corresponding targets (`make lint`, `./dev-env.sh lint`).
   - Document commands in README and contributor guide.
3. **Optional Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Evaluate adoption of Husky or Lefthook for git hooks running lint/format on staged files.
   - Provide opt-in instructions to avoid blocking workflows where hooks are undesirable.
4. **CI Workflow Updates**
   - Create a dedicated `code-quality` job in GitHub Actions triggered on PRs and main branch pushes.
   - Steps:
     - Check out code and install dependencies using node cache.
     - Run `yarn lint` and optional `yarn format --check` (or `prettier --check`).
     - Fail job with clear messaging on violations.
   - Configure job to run before build-and-push; optionally set as required check for merging.
5. **Reporting & Developer Feedback**
   - Surface lint results in GitHub summaries for quick scanning.
   - If adopting multiple linters, collate outputs to single consolidated report.
6. **Maintenance & Governance**
   - Schedule quarterly review of lint rules to align with language updates.
   - Update documentation when rules or tooling change.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** CI minutes, package scripts, documentation updates, optional hook tooling.
- **Dependencies:** Node.js environment in CI, existing ESLint/Prettier configs, package.json scripts.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (rule ownership), DevOps team (CI modifications), Documentation maintainers (guides), Project leads (enforcing merge requirements).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 1–2 engineering days.
  1. Half-day: Tooling inventory and local command additions.
  2. Half-day: CI job creation and documentation updates.
  3. Half-day (buffer): Hook evaluation and stakeholder sign-off.
- Schedule after automated testing infrastructure (Recommendation L) to allow combined quality gates in CI but before broader deployment enhancements.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Developer Friction from Strict Rules:** Start with existing rules; communicate changes and offer autofix guidance.
- **CI Runtime Increases:** Cache dependencies, run linting in parallel with tests where possible.
- **False Positives or Plugin Instability:** Pin linter versions and test after upgrades; provide skip options for exceptional cases.
- **Hook Disruption:** Make pre-commit hooks optional and document disable instructions to avoid blocking urgent hotfixes.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Local Dry Runs:** Execute new scripts across different contributor environments (macOS, Linux, Docker) to ensure consistency.
- **CI Trial:** Run updated workflow on feature branch to validate caching, runtimes, and failure messaging.
- **Regression Monitoring:** Track lint failure frequency post-implementation; adjust documentation or rules based on feedback.
- **Documentation Verification:** Have peers follow instructions to confirm setup clarity and reproducibility.
