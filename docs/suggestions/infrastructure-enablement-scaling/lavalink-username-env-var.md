# Implementation Plan: Move Hardcoded Username to Environment Variable

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Replace the hardcoded Lavalink client username in [`createLavalinkManager()`](src/lib/LavalinkManager.js:8) with a configurable environment variable to improve deployment flexibility.
- Ensure all deployment targets (local, Docker, CI/CD) provide the username through standard environment configuration.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- The Lavalink manager reads the username exclusively from process environment (e.g., `process.env.LAVALINK_CLIENT_USERNAME`) with a safe fallback.
- [`.env.example`](.env.example) and deployment manifests document and supply the new variable.
- Successful connection logs confirm the configured username in staging and production without code changes.
- Regression metric: no increase in Lavalink authentication failures after rollout.

## 3. Technical Approach and Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. Confirm the hardcoded username location in [`createLavalinkManager()`](src/lib/LavalinkManager.js:8) and verify no other files rely on the literal "DimbyBot".
2. Define a new variable name (proposed `LAVALINK_CLIENT_USERNAME`) and add entries to [`.env.example`](.env.example) and [`dev-env.sh`](dev-env.sh) with descriptive comments and placeholder values.
3. Update [`createLavalinkManager()`](src/lib/LavalinkManager.js:8) to read the username from `process.env.LAVALINK_CLIENT_USERNAME`, falling back to `client.user?.username ?? "DimbyBot"` with a warning log when the env variable is absent.
4. Review deployment assets—[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](docker-compose.dev.yml), [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)—to inject the new variable where appropriate, ensuring secrets management aligns with existing patterns.
5. Coordinate with infrastructure maintainers to add the variable to CI/CD secrets (GitHub Actions, production server environment) and document required values.
6. Update project documentation ([`README.md`](README.md) configuration section and release notes) to instruct operators on supplying the variable.
7. Implement logging improvements: emit an info-level line after manager initialization showing the active username (redacting sensitive values if necessary).
8. Schedule a brief configuration smoke test on staging, adjusting scripts or Terraform (if applicable) to export the variable.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- Resources: access to environment configuration files, CI/CD secret management, staging Lavalink instance for validation.
- Dependencies: availability of the Discord bot client identity (to derive fallback username), scheduling with DevOps/infra for secret rotation.
- Stakeholders: bot maintainers for code changes, DevOps engineers for deployment configuration, QA for validation.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~0.5 day for development and docs, ~0.5 day for deployment coordination.
- Sequence: perform code updates first, follow with configuration file updates, then coordinate deployment changes and testing.
- Can be executed within the current sprint without blocking other features.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Missing environment variable in production → Mitigate with default fallback and loud warning logs plus CI validation that checks for the variable before deployment.
- Divergent values across environments causing inconsistent Lavalink identities → Document expected values and standardize via shared secret management templates.
- Logging of sensitive identifiers → Ensure logs only indicate the username string without exposing credentials; redact if necessary.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- Unit/Integration: run existing Lavalink connection flows locally with the new env variable set and unset to confirm fallback behavior.
- Configuration validation: use docker-compose environment overrides to verify the variable propagates correctly in containers.
- Monitoring: after deployment, review logs for successful manager initialization message and monitor error rates for 24 hours.
- Add a checklist item to release notes ensuring operators confirm the variable before promoting to production.
