# Implementation Plan: Create Development Database Setup

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Provide a standardized database environment for local development to support upcoming features requiring persistent storage (e.g., playlist persistence, user preferences).
- Deliver infrastructure, tooling, and documentation so contributors can spin up, seed, and reset the development database with minimal friction.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Developers can provision the database and connect the bot within 5 minutes using documented commands.
- Ensure schema migrations run consistently across environments with zero manual SQL execution.
- Maintain automated sanity checks verifying database connectivity during `make up` / `./dev-env.sh up`.
- Achieve â‰¥80% adoption by active contributors within one sprint, tracked via onboarding checklist completion.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Database Technology Selection**
   - Choose a relational database aligned with production roadmap; recommend PostgreSQL (commented service already present in `docker-compose.yml`).
   - Document justification (ecosystem maturity, JSON support, compatibility with Discord bot use cases).

2. **Containerized Database Provisioning**
   - Uncomment/refine `postgres-db` service in `docker-compose.yml` and mirror in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
   - Define environment variables (`POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) via `.env.example` and secrets management.
   - Configure named volumes for data persistence; expose port (e.g., 5433) for local access with optional toggle.

3. **ORM/Query Layer Integration**
   - Evaluate lightweight ORM or query builder (Prisma, Drizzle, Knex) based on schema complexity and migration support.
   - Add dependency and initialize schema/migration directory (e.g., `prisma/schema.prisma`, `migrations/`).

4. **Configuration in Bot Code**
   - Introduce configuration module for database connection using environment variables.
   - Implement connection lifecycle management (pooling, graceful shutdown) within bot startup sequence.
   - Add data access layer skeletons (e.g., repositories/services) for future feature work.

5. **Migration & Seeding Workflow**
   - Provide scripts (`yarn db:migrate`, `yarn db:seed`) integrated with ORM tool.
   - Ensure migrations execute during development startup (optional automation in Makefile/`dev-env.sh`).
   - Include sample seed data relevant to upcoming features (users, playlists, guild settings).

6. **Developer Tooling Enhancements**
   - Update Makefile and `dev-env.sh` with database commands (`make db-up`, `make db-shell`, `./dev-env.sh db:reset`).
   - Supply connection helpers (e.g., `.psqlrc`, VS Code database connection guide).
   - Add documentation sections in README/contributor guide detailing setup, troubleshooting, and reset instructions.

7. **Integration with Tests and CI**
   - Extend automated testing plan to use in-memory or containerized PostgreSQL during test runs (align with Recommendation L).
   - Optionally create GitHub Actions service container for database when running integration tests.

8. **Security & Data Hygiene**
   - Store credentials in `.env` templates with development-safe defaults; emphasize not to reuse production secrets.
   - Document data reset policies and provide scripts to wipe volumes if corruption occurs.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** PostgreSQL Docker image, ORM library, updated environment files, migration tooling.
- **Dependencies:** Container orchestration (Docker Compose), upcoming persistence features, testing infrastructure.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend engineers (schema design), DevOps (compose templates, CI integration), QA (seed data and integration scenarios), Documentation maintainers.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 3 engineering days.
  1. Day 1: Database selection confirmation, Compose updates, ORM bootstrap.
  2. Day 2: Bot integration, migration scripts, seeding.
  3. Day 3: Tooling, documentation, and validation with developers.
- Target completion before implementing features needing persistence (playlist persistence) and before comprehensive testing rollout to ensure test suites can rely on consistent data stores.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Schema Drift Between Dev and Future Production:** Adopt migrations and version control; enforce review of schema changes.
- **Resource Overhead on Developer Machines:** Keep PostgreSQL configuration lightweight (shared buffers, max connections) and document docker resource requirements.
- **Data Contamination:** Provide reset scripts and guidance on separating dev/test databases.
- **Authentication Complexity:** Use simple credentials locally but ensure production readiness by abstracting config to environment variables.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Functional Validation:** Launch bot with database enabled, run smoke commands that rely on DB interactions (once features exist).
- **Migration Testing:** Execute migrations up/down on fresh instances; include in CI to prevent drift.
- **Connectivity Checks:** Implement startup health probe verifying DB connection; log actionable errors.
- **Documentation Review:** Conduct peer walkthrough using instructions to confirm reproducibility; collect feedback for iterative improvements.
