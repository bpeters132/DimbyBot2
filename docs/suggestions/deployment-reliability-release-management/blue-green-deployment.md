# Implementation Plan: Implement Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Transition the production deployment process (currently orchestrated by [`CI/CD` workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml:1) and remote Docker Compose) to a blue-green model that runs two concurrent environments (Blue and Green) to enable zero-downtime releases.
- Introduce deployment automation to provision, validate, and switch traffic between the two environments while maintaining rollback capability.
- Preserve the existing development workflow where local changes run through [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](docker-compose.dev.yml:1) with bind-mounted source code.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Achieve zero-downtime deploys with validated cutovers between Blue and Green environments measured over three consecutive production releases.
- Ensure switchovers can be completed within five minutes, including health verification and traffic routing changes.
- Maintain automated rollback to the previously active environment with a maximum recovery time objective (RTO) of 10 minutes.
- Provide auditable deployment records indicating which color is active, who initiated the switch, and associated commit SHA.

## 3. Technical Approach and Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Infrastructure assessment and design**
   - Inventory production server resources to confirm capacity for running two full Docker Compose stacks concurrently (CPU, RAM, persistent volumes).
   - Define naming conventions for services, networks, and volumes (e.g., `dimbybot_blue`, `dimbybot_green`) to avoid conflicts.
   - Document the traffic routing mechanism (e.g., Nginx reverse proxy, load balancer, Discord webhook) and how it will toggle between environments.

2. **Blueprinting environment layout**
   - Extend [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml:1) and remote deployment scripts (`ci_deploy.sh` generated in [`deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml:1)) to parameterize stack names and compose project designations.
   - Provide separate `.env.blue` and `.env.green` (or templated variants) for environment-specific variables, ensuring secrets remain consistent or intentionally distinct.

3. **Automate blue/green provisioning**
   - Modify the GitHub Actions deploy job to:
     - Determine the inactive color (e.g., via stored state file or remote command).
     - Deploy the new release to the inactive color using `docker compose -p dimbybot_green up -d`.
     - Run database migrations or configuration updates against the inactive stack only after validation.

4. **Smoke testing and validation**
   - Execute automated health and functional tests (see Recommendation I) against the inactive environment using a dedicated Discord test guild or staging channel.
   - Include canary checks: command invocation, Lavalink connectivity, and log inspection.
   - Persist test artifacts for auditing.

5. **Traffic switch implementation**
   - Update remote scripts to switch active traffic:
     - Adjust reverse proxy configs (e.g., symlink swap, Nginx upstream change) or environment variables that control which container the bot process attaches to.
     - Send a controlled restart or STOP/START sequence ensuring Discord token uniqueness (only one active bot process).
   - Update status indicators (e.g., `current_color` file) to reflect the new active environment.

6. **Rollback framework**
   - Implement a `rollback` job or script that reactivates the previously active color, leveraging the stored metadata to identify the last known good stack.
   - Automate notifications (e.g., GitHub Actions summary, Slack alerts) whenever a rollback occurs.

7. **Observability and reporting**
   - Update logging and monitoring pipelines to tag metrics with the environment color.
   - Summarize deployment status at the end of the GitHub Action run (active color, commit SHA, validation results).

8. **Knowledge transfer and documentation**
   - Produce a runbook covering deployment flow, state management, rollback steps, and troubleshooting.
   - Train maintainers on new workflow and update SOPs.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Production server capacity for dual stacks, access to reverse proxy or traffic-switching mechanism, GitHub Actions permissions.
- **Dependencies:** Health-check framework (Recommendation I), multi-stage Docker images (Recommendation E) to minimize resource footprint.
- **Stakeholders:** DevOps/infra team (infrastructure and automation), backend engineers (application validation), QA team (smoke tests), operations/on-call staff (rollback and monitoring).

## 5. Timeline and Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 3â€“4 engineering days plus coordination.
  1. Day 1: Infrastructure assessment, environment blueprint, compose parameterization.
  2. Day 2: Workflow automation and provisioning scripts.
  3. Day 3: Validation suite integration and traffic switch mechanics.
  4. Day 4 (buffer): Documentation, training, and pilot release.
- Prioritize after Recommendations E, F, and G to leverage optimized build artifacts; execute before Recommendation I to ensure rollback hooks align with blue-green flow.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Insufficient capacity for dual stacks:** Mitigate by evaluating resource usage and scaling up hardware or optimizing container resource limits.
- **Stateful data inconsistencies:** Ensure shared volumes (downloads, storage) are compatible with dual deployment; consider read-only mounts or separate volumes per color with explicit migration steps.
- **Traffic switch failure:** Implement transactional updates to proxy configuration with automatic rollback; pre-validate configuration before reload.
- **Operational complexity:** Provide clear tooling (CLI scripts) and alerting to reduce manual errors.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit-level:** Test modified deployment scripts locally using a staging server or containerized environment.
- **Integration:** Perform rehearsal deployments to a staging environment cycling through Blue/Green transitions, verifying health checks and traffic swaps.
- **Load/soak testing:** Keep the inactive environment running under synthetic load prior to cutover to catch resource contention.
- **Post-deployment monitoring:** Track error rates, latency, and bot connectivity metrics for at least one hour after each cutover; auto-trigger rollback if thresholds are exceeded.
