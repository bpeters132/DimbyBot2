# Implementation Plan: Implement Advanced Queue Visualization

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Redesign the Discord bot’s queue presentation to deliver rich, paginated embeds with enhanced metadata (track durations, requester info, thumbnails).
- Introduce developer tooling and utilities that support multiple visualization modes (compact, detailed, control-channel snapshot) while preserving Discord API limits and responsiveness.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Provide paginated queue embeds that render within Discord message limits and support queues of 200+ tracks.
- Reduce the average time for moderators to locate a specific track by ≥30% (tracked via telemetry or beta feedback).
- Maintain response latency for `/queue` command under 1.5 seconds for typical guild queues (<50 tracks).
- Reach ≥80% adoption of the new visualization within two sprints, measured via configuration telemetry or guild feedback surveys.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Discovery & Requirements Gathering**
   - Audit current queue surfaces: `/queue` command ([`src/commands/music/Queue.js`](src/commands/music/Queue.js:1)), control channel embeds ([`src/events/handlers/handleControlChannel.js`](src/events/handlers/handleControlChannel.js:1)), developer tooling panel (`PlayerCtl` in [`src/commands/developer/PlayerCtl.js`](src/commands/developer/PlayerCtl.js:1)).
   - Interview moderators and power users to document desired metadata (artwork, requester avatar, elapsed time, playback source).
   - Define accessibility requirements (readable colors, alternative text) and identify multi-locale strings to externalize.

2. **Design & Prototyping**
   - Produce wireframes (Figma/Excalidraw) for:
     - Detailed queue page with thumbnail, duration, requester, estimated wait.
     - Compact view for control channel snapshot.
     - Pagination controls (buttons/select menus) and ephemeral preview flows.
   - Create design reference under `docs/design/queue-visualization/` (add new assets if not existing).

3. **Visualization Utility Implementation**
   - Build `src/util/queueVisualization.js` to encapsulate embed generation, pagination, and formatting helpers.
   - Implement data mappers that convert Lavalink queue entries into display-friendly DTOs, including time remaining calculation using [`src/util/formatDuration.js`](src/util/formatDuration.js:1).
   - Provide layout variants (`detailed`, `compact`, `controlSnapshot`) with shared base styles.

4. **Command & Event Integration**
   - Refactor `/queue` command to rely on new utility, adding slash command options for view mode and filter criteria (e.g., requester-specific view).
   - Enhance pagination interaction handlers (buttons/select menus) to maintain state across updates and handle concurrency.
   - Update control channel workflow to provide quick “Open queue preview” button that sends ephemeral embed to requesting user.

5. **Optional Stretch: External Visualization**
   - Investigate generating static images (Canvas/Sharp) or lightweight web dashboard for extended queue display. Gate rendering behind feature flag for future rollout.
   - Ensure OAuth/session management and rate-limit compliance if web view is pursued.

6. **Documentation & Rollout**
   - Update `README.md` and release notes with screenshots, usage instructions, and configuration toggles.
   - Add admin configuration snippet describing how to enable/disable advanced views or revert to legacy mode.
   - Coordinate beta testing in staged guilds, collecting feedback through survey or Discord channel.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Design tooling (Figma), image rendering libs (optional Canvas/Sharp), Discord component documentation, staging guild for QA.
- **Dependencies:** Lavalink queue data access, environment configuration toggles (Recommendation O), performance monitoring enhancements (Recommendation Q) to track latency changes.
- **Stakeholders:** UX/design contributor for layout approval, community/moderator representatives for feedback, backend developers for implementation, QA for regression testing.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated timeline: ~3 engineering days plus design collaboration.
  1. Day 1: Requirements validation, wireframes, visualization utility scaffolding.
  2. Day 2: `/queue` command refactor, pagination interactions, control channel updates.
  3. Day 3: Optional stretch exploration, documentation, beta rollout coordination.
- Schedule after seeding scripts (Recommendation R) so QA can leverage seeded playlists, and parallel with performance monitoring (Recommendation Q) to observe latency impact.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Discord Embed Limits (character, field count):** Build automatic truncation and fallback messaging; consider splitting data across multiple embeds when necessary.
- **Increased Response Latency:** Cache computed queue metadata, utilize worker to precompute heavy fields, and monitor via performance metrics.
- **Visual Clutter for Small Queues:** Implement adaptive layouts that collapse to minimal view when queue length ≤3, with toggle to expand.
- **User Resistance to Change:** Provide configuration toggle for legacy view during transition, gather feedback, and iterate before deprecating.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Cover `queueVisualization.js` formatting logic, pagination calculations, and truncation safeguards.
- **Manual QA:** Validate on desktop/mobile Discord clients, dark/light themes, varying queue sizes (0, 1, 10, 200 tracks), and special cases (streams, missing thumbnails).
- **Load Testing:** Simulate rapid pagination interactions to ensure rate limits are not triggered and command handlers remain responsive.
- **Beta Feedback Loop:** Deploy to select guilds, capture reactions via structured survey, and track command usage metrics before general release.
