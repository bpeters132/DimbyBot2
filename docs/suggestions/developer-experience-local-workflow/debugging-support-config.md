# Implementation Plan: Add Debugging Support

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Introduce first-class debugging capabilities for the Discord bot so developers can attach debuggers, set breakpoints, and inspect runtime state.
- Provide standardized VS Code launch configurations and Docker Compose updates that expose Node.js debug ports while preserving hot-reload workflows.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Enable developers to launch the bot with an attached VS Code debugger in under two minutes using documented steps.
- Achieve breakpoint hit reliability of ≥99% during local debugging sessions without disrupting Lavalink connectivity.
- Ensure Docker-based development environment supports simultaneous debugging and hot reload (`nodemon`) without container restarts.
- Track adoption by adding a checklist item in onboarding; success when ≥80% of new contributors confirm debugging setup within their first sprint.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Baseline Analysis**
   - Review existing local workflows (Makefile, `dev-env.sh`, Docker compose overrides) to determine entry points and command hooks.
   - Identify port availability and security requirements for exposing the Node inspector (default 9229).
2. **Node Inspector Enablement**
   - Update development start scripts (`yarn dev`, nodemon config) to allow `--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229` flag behind an environment toggle (e.g., `DEBUG_PORT_ENABLED`).
   - Adjust `Dockerfile.dev` or relevant entrypoint to respect debugging environment variables.
3. **Docker Compose Adjustments**
   - Modify `docker-compose.dev.yml` to map the chosen inspector port, ensuring hot-reload nodemon process runs with inspector attached.
   - Add conditional port exposure (only when debugging enabled) to avoid conflicts.
4. **VS Code Launch Configuration**
   - Create `.vscode/launch.json` template with configurations for:
     - Attach to Node process in Docker (using `debug` URL).
     - Launch locally without Docker for lightweight debugging.
   - Document environment variables and prerequisites within configuration comments.
5. **Quality-of-Life Enhancements**
   - Provide `Makefile`/`dev-env.sh` commands (e.g., `make debug` or `./dev-env.sh debug`) that set required env vars and start services with inspector enabled.
   - Add documentation snippet in README and contributor guide explaining usage flow.
6. **Validation & Automation**
   - Integrate a self-check step (script) that verifies port binding and debugger connectivity (e.g., curl the inspector JSON endpoint).
   - Optionally add CI lint to ensure `.vscode/launch.json` exists and is kept in sync (or document manual validation procedures).

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Updates to development container assets, VS Code workspace configuration, optional shell scripts.
- **Dependencies:** Existing Docker Compose dev setup, nodemon configuration, Node.js LTS version compatibility with inspector.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (primary users), DevOps team (Docker networking adjustments), Documentation maintainers (README updates), Onboarding coordinators.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 1–2 engineering days.
  1. Half-day: Baseline analysis and Node inspector enablement.
  2. Half-day: Compose updates and VS Code launch configuration.
  3. Half-day (buffer): Documentation, validation scripts, and internal review.
- Prioritize before automated testing (Recommendation L) to assist in diagnosing test failures and during code quality initiatives (Recommendation M).

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Port Conflicts:** Establish configurable port environment variable; document fallback options.
- **Performance Overhead:** Ensure inspector only active when explicitly enabled to avoid production impact.
- **Security Exposure:** Limit debugging port exposure to localhost or trusted networks; warn against enabling inspector in production compose files.
- **Tool Drift:** Automate configuration checks or schedule periodic reviews during dependency bumps.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Manual Validation:** Run debug-enabled compose stack, attach VS Code debugger, confirm breakpoints hit in key command handlers.
- **Automated Check:** Script that verifies inspector endpoint availability when debug mode enabled.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure standard `make up` (without debug flag) remains unaffected; run core bot commands to confirm nodemon reloads.
- **Documentation Review:** Conduct peer walkthrough using new instructions to guarantee clarity and reproducibility.
