# Implementation Plan: Add Metrics Collection for Monitoring

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Instrument DimbyBot and its Lavalink stack with Prometheus-compatible metrics, ship dashboards in Grafana, and integrate alerting so operators can observe performance, latency, and reliability trends.
- Provide consistent telemetry across environments (local, staging, production) to support rapid diagnosis, capacity planning, and regression detection.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Expose core metrics endpoints for both the bot and Lavalink within two sprints, compliant with Prometheus scraping (histograms, counters, gauges).
- Deliver at least three production dashboards: command latency, playback health (queue depth, failures), infrastructure status (CPU, memory, node availability).
- Implement alert rules detecting critical anomalies (Lavalink disconnects, error-rate spikes) with notification latency under 2 minutes.
- Ensure <5% runtime overhead from metrics collection by benchmarking before/after CPU and memory usage.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Telemetry Requirements & Inventory**
   - Catalog existing logs and data points in [`src/lib/Logger.js`](src/lib/Logger.js:1), `lavaManagerEvents`, and `lavaNodeEvents`.
   - Define metric catalog (name, type, labels) covering command throughput, queue sizes, playback errors, voice reconnections, Lavalink node stats, resource usage.
   - Align with stakeholders on retention needs, alert priorities, data privacy constraints.

2. **Bot Instrumentation Layer**
   - Introduce metrics middleware (`src/lib/metrics/index.js`) using `prom-client` for Node.js.
   - Hook measurement points:
     - Slash command execution (`src/commands/**`) for latency and outcome counters.
     - Queue management (`src/util/musicManager.js`) for queue length, search success, fallback usage.
     - Voice events for reconnect counts and failures.
   - Provide HTTP endpoint `/metrics` guarded by environment flags (`METRICS_ENABLED`, `METRICS_BASIC_AUTH`).

3. **Lavalink Metrics Integration**
   - Enable Lavalink Prometheus exporter via `Lavalink/application.yml` configuration (port, authentication).
   - Update Compose/Docker manifests (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`) to expose metrics ports internally; secure production access via network policies.
   - If using hosted Lavalink, coordinate with operators to deploy metrics plugin or expose `/stats` for scraping.

4. **Prometheus & Grafana Setup**
   - Provision Prometheus configuration (scrape jobs for bot, Lavalink) stored under `infra/monitoring/prometheus/`.
   - Create Grafana dashboards (JSON exports under `docs/monitoring/dashboards/`) covering:
     - Command performance & error rates.
     - Playback health (Lavalink node load, track transitions, effect usage).
     - Infrastructure overview (CPU/memory, container restarts).
   - Configure alerting rules (Alertmanager or Grafana) for key thresholds (e.g., command latency > 2s p95 for 5 minutes, Lavalink disconnect count > 3).

5. **Local Development & CI Support**
   - Add Makefile / `dev-env.sh` commands (`make metrics-up`, `./dev-env.sh metrics`) to launch Prometheus/Grafana stack locally.
   - Provide sample datasets or simulations (e.g., `yarn metrics:demo`) to showcase dashboards without production data.
   - Integrate metrics smoke test in CI: ensure `/metrics` endpoint responds and basic counters increment during test suite.

6. **Documentation & Operational Playbooks**
   - Write operator guide `docs/suggestions/metrics-operations-guide.md` detailing dashboard usage, alert runbooks, retention settings.
   - Update `README.md` with monitoring architecture overview, local setup instructions, and support link for access requests.
   - Coordinate knowledge transfer session with DevOps/on-call team to review dashboards and alert thresholds.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Prometheus & Grafana infrastructure (self-hosted or managed), `prom-client`, alerting channels (Slack, PagerDuty), storage for dashboards.
- **Dependencies:** Environment-specific configuration system (Recommendation O) for toggles/credentials, health checks (Recommendation W) for actionable alert context, audio effects metrics (Recommendation V) to track resource impact.
- **Stakeholders:** DevOps/SRE (provisioning, alerts), Backend developers (instrumentation), QA (validation scripts), Management/on-call leads (alert recipients).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~5 engineering days plus DevOps coordination.
  1. Day 1: Metric catalog agreement, instrumentation scaffolding.
  2. Day 2: Bot metric implementation, `/metrics` endpoint.
  3. Day 3: Lavalink metrics enablement, Prometheus configuration.
  4. Day 4: Dashboard creation, alert rule definition, local stack integration.
  5. Day 5: Documentation, CI smoke tests, handoff to operations.
- Prioritize after health checks (Recommendation W) so alerts tie to probes, but before major feature rollouts dependent on monitoring data (e.g., audio effects).

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance Overhead:** Benchmark instrumentation impact; disable verbose metrics via feature flag in resource-constrained environments.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Sanitize labels (no user IDs), enforce allowlist for metric names, restrict metrics endpoint access with authentication or IP allowlists.
- **Monitoring Stack Complexity:** Provide IaC templates and use containerized stack for local testing; document upgrade/maintenance procedures.
- **Alert Fatigue:** Start with minimal, high-signal alerts; review weekly and adjust thresholds to avoid noise.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Verify metric registration and increments for key code paths; ensure double-registration is avoided.
- **Integration Tests:** Run scenario tests that trigger command usage, queue changes, and confirm metrics reflect expected values.
- **Load Testing:** Simulate high command volume to ensure Prometheus scraping remains stable and endpoint performance meets latency goals.
- **Staging Validation:** Deploy metrics stack in staging, run playback sessions, confirm dashboards populate; test alert pathways by inducing threshold breaches.
- **Operational Audits:** Schedule periodic review (monthly) of dashboard accuracy, alert correctness, and metric retention to prevent drift.
