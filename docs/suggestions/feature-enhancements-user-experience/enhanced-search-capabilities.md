# Implementation Plan: Enhance Search Capabilities

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Upgrade music search to support fuzzy matching, alternative spellings, and partial titles by augmenting Lavalink queries with local heuristics.
- Deliver preview embeds that show top results (title, duration, requester context) before adding to queue, letting users confirm selections quickly.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Increase first-try track match rate by ≥20% as measured via telemetry comparing successful searches vs. retries.
- Reduce manual re-entry of queries by ≥30% within two sprints (tracked through command analytics and feedback surveys).
- Maintain median `/play` command response latency under 1.5 seconds with preview enabled; cap preview flow to ≤3 interactions per search.
- Achieve ≥80% user satisfaction in beta guild survey regarding result accuracy and preview usefulness.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Discovery & Requirements Validation**
   - Analyze existing search pipeline in [`src/util/musicManager.js`](src/util/musicManager.js:1) (particularly `handleQueryAndPlay`) to identify decision points.
   - Gather moderator and power-user feedback on common failure cases (misspellings, abbreviations, alternate languages).
   - Formalize preview UX requirements (embed layout, navigation, fallback for legacy mode).

2. **Fuzzy Matching & Query Enhancement Layer**
   - Implement normalization and tokenization helpers in `src/util/searchUtils.js` (new file) handling accent stripping, lowercasing, and fuzzy scoring (Levenshtein or `fuse.js`).
   - Extend `handleQueryAndPlay` to:
     - Detect likely typos using heuristic thresholds.
     - Retry Lavalink search with corrected tokens, synonyms, or appended keywords (e.g., “lyrics” removal).
     - Cache recent query corrections for per-guild reuse.
   - Introduce optional fallback to YouTube Music or Spotify API (if keys available) for additional match hints, encapsulated behind feature flags.

3. **Result Preview Generation**
   - Develop `src/util/searchPreview.js` to format search results into Discord embeds with track title, duration (`src/util/formatDuration.js`), channel name, thumbnail, and preview index.
   - Update `/play` command (`src/commands/music/Play.js`) to:
     - Present top N (configurable, default 5) results in a preview when fuzzy corrections were applied or multiple close matches exist.
     - Provide interaction handlers (buttons/select menu) to confirm selection, retry search, or cancel.
   - Ensure control channel updates respect preview selections and do not double-add tracks.

4. **Configuration & Feature Flags**
   - Integrate with environment configuration plan (`docs/suggestions/environment-specific-configs.md`) to expose toggles: `SEARCH_FUZZY_ENABLED`, `SEARCH_PREVIEW_ENABLED`, preview size limits.
   - Add guild-configurable overrides (future-ready) by defining settings schema for persistent preferences (compatible with upcoming storage work).

5. **Telemetry & Logging Enhancements**
   - Instrument metrics within search flow to record raw query, corrected query, result source, and success/failure (ensuring no PII leakage).
   - Emit structured debug logs to analyze false positives during beta rollout; provide aggregated dashboard tie-in with metrics recommendation (Recommendation X).

6. **Documentation & Rollout Assets**
   - Update `README.md` command documentation describing new preview behavior and opt-out mechanisms.
   - Create troubleshooting section in `docs/suggestions/search-preview-guide.md` (supporting doc if needed later) outlining correction logic and known limitations.
   - Prepare moderator announcement template and beta feedback survey.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** `fuse.js` or lightweight fuzzy-matching library, additional Lavalink/LavaSearch endpoints, design support for embed layout.
- **Dependencies:** Existing queue management (`musicManager`), upcoming environment configuration work, telemetry infrastructure (Recommendation X) for metrics collection.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (implementation), DevOps (feature flag rollout), QA (multi-guild preview testing), Community managers (communication).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated timeline: ~4 engineering days plus QA.
  1. Day 1: Requirements finalization, search utility scaffolding, fuzzy matching prototype.
  2. Day 2: Integration with `Play` command and preview UX, interaction handlers.
  3. Day 3: Telemetry wiring, configuration toggles, automated testing.
  4. Day 4: Documentation, beta deployment, feedback loop setup.
- Schedule after playlist persistence (Recommendation T) to reuse storage utilities if per-guild preview preferences are needed; align with metrics collection plan for observability.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **False Positives (wrong auto-corrections):** Keep correction threshold conservative, always provide preview confirmation, allow `/play --raw` override to skip fuzzy layer.
  - **Mitigation:** Log corrections and provide opt-out flag per guild/user.
- **Increased Latency:** Batch Lavalink queries, reuse cached corrections, and parallelize preview data fetching.
  - **Mitigation:** set strict timeout for auxiliary lookups, degrade gracefully to legacy search.
- **API Rate Limits (external hint sources):** Implement rate limiting and caching; make integrations optional and keyed via environment configuration.
- **UX Complexity:** Provide clear instructions in embed footer and keep interactions minimal; allow fallback to legacy mode.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Validate fuzzy matching helpers, correction thresholds, and preview rendering utilities.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate `/play` workflows with various typo cases; ensure queue updates reflect confirmed selection only.
- **Load/Latency Testing:** Measure response times under concurrent preview interactions; confirm no Discord rate limits hit.
- **Beta Rollout:** Enable feature in select guilds, monitor telemetry dashboards for success rate improvements, collect qualitative feedback before full release.
- **Regression Checks:** Confirm legacy search command path remains available when feature flags disabled and automated tests cover both enabled/disabled scenarios.
