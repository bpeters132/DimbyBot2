# Implementation Plan: Add Audio Effects Support via Lavalink Filters

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Expose Lavalink filter capabilities (e.g., bass boost, nightcore, karaoke, tremolo) through Discord commands so users can customize audio output per guild or per session.
- Provide safe defaults, persistent configurations, and guardrails to ensure effects do not degrade performance or violate Discord’s audio guidelines.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Deliver `/effects` command suite enabling at least five popular presets plus granular parameter adjustments.
- Maintain playback stability: <1% increase in track dropouts or Lavalink node CPU usage under typical load when effects are active.
- Achieve ≥60% adoption among beta guilds (at least one effect applied weekly) within the first month.
- Ensure configuration persists across bot restarts (when combined with upcoming persistence efforts) and can be reset quickly.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Capability Assessment**
   - Review Lavalink filter API (`player.filters`) and current usage patterns in [`src/lib/LavalinkManager.js`](src/lib/LavalinkManager.js:1) and [`src/util/musicManager.js`](src/util/musicManager.js:1).
   - Document supported filters, parameter ranges, and mechanical limitations in `docs/` (table of preset parameters).

2. **Effect Preset Definitions**
   - Create `src/config/effectsPresets.js` mapping friendly names (e.g., `bassboost`, `nightcore`, `karaoke`, `vaporwave`, `treble`) to filter payloads (equalizer bands, timescale, karaoke).
   - Include metadata: description, intensity level, recommended use cases, and compatibility notes (e.g., timescale transforms voice pitch).

3. **Command Implementation**
   - Add `/effects` slash command under `src/commands/music/Effects.js` with subcommands:
     - `/effects preset <name>`: enable preset.
     - `/effects custom` with options for timescale speed/pitch, equalizer gain adjustments, etc.
     - `/effects off`: reset filters to default.
     - `/effects list`: display available presets and active effect.
   - Leverage Discord component interactions (buttons/select menu) for quick toggles when appropriate.

4. **Player Integration & State Management**
   - Extend music manager to track active effect per player (`player.filters` plus in-memory state) and ensure new tracks inherit filters until disabled.
   - Implement optional persistence stub referencing playlist storage plan for future durable settings (e.g., JSON store or DB).
   - Update control channel embed (`handleControlChannel.js`) to show active effect badge and add quick reset button.

5. **Feedback & Safety Mechanisms**
   - Add validation to clamp user-provided values within safe ranges (avoid clipping or distortions).
   - When applying filters, send acknowledgement embed summarizing active parameters and estimated latency impact.
   - Provide error handling: automatic rollback if Lavalink returns error or filter application exceeds timeout.

6. **Operational Tooling**
   - Create developer command `/playerctl effects` (in `src/commands/developer/PlayerCtl.js`) to inspect current filter payload for debugging.
   - Include script/logging to audit effect usage frequency for observability (ties into metrics collection recommendation).

7. **Documentation & Rollout**
   - Update `README.md` and create `docs/suggestions/audio-effects-guide.md` (if deeper instructions needed) with explanations, limitations, and recommended presets.
   - Draft moderation guidelines for effect usage to prevent abuse (e.g., limit high pitch/tempo distortions).

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Lavalink filter API documentation, test guilds with Lavalink access, audio testing tooling (e.g., OBS, waveform visualizer).
- **Dependencies:** Stable Lavalink nodes (Recommendation W health checks), configuration framework for persistence, metrics plan to monitor CPU/latency.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (command implementation), DevOps (Lavalink configuration, instance monitoring), QA/audio testers, community moderators (usage policies).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~4 engineering days plus coordinated QA.
  1. Day 1: Capability assessment, preset definitions, command scaffolding.
  2. Day 2: Player integration, control channel updates, validation logic.
  3. Day 3: Testing (unit + manual audio verification), developer tools.
  4. Day 4: Documentation, beta rollout prep, telemetry hooks.
- Schedule after playlist persistence groundwork but before comprehensive monitoring so metrics instrumentation (Recommendation X) can capture effect usage.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Audio Distortion or User Discomfort:** Provide preview warnings, limit extreme parameter ranges, and add quick disable commands.
- **Performance Impact on Lavalink Nodes:** Monitor CPU/memory metrics; pause effect application if thresholds exceeded (tie into health checks).
- **State Drift Between Tracks:** Ensure filters reset on `/effects off` and new sessions start in neutral state; add guard to remove filters when queue empties.
- **Complex UX:** Offer preset shortcuts, minimal parameter options, and thorough help messages (`/effects help` or embed footer instructions).

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Validate preset payload generation, parameter clamping, and command option parsing.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate enabling/disabling effects during playback, ensure filters persist across track transitions, and that `/effects off` restores defaults.
- **Manual Audio QA:** In staging guild, test each preset for audio quality across multiple tracks, gather subjective feedback.
- **Load Testing:** Evaluate Lavalink resource usage with effects enabled across concurrent guilds (requires coordination with DevOps).
- **Regression Checks:** Ensure existing playback commands remain unaffected when effects disabled, and control channel messaging stays responsive.
