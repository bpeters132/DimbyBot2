# Implementation Plan: Consider Multi-Node Lavalink Cluster

## 1. Recommendation Summary
- Expand the current single-node Lavalink deployment into a resilient multi-node cluster to eliminate single points of failure and support higher concurrent playback volume.
- Introduce load balancing, automated failover, and observability that allow the Discord bot to seamlessly route requests to healthy Lavalink nodes.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Maintain uninterrupted audio playback during node outages; targeted recovery time objective (RTO) < 30 seconds.
- Scale to at least 3× the present peak concurrent guild sessions without observable latency spikes (< 150 ms average Lavalink response).
- Achieve 99.9% Lavalink availability over a 30-day measurement window with automated alerting on threshold breaches.
- Ensure configuration automation so a new node can join the cluster in < 15 minutes with no manual code changes.

## 3. Technical Approach and Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Baseline Assessment**
   - Capture current node throughput, CPU, and memory metrics.
   - Identify existing deployment footprint (single server vs. container orchestration) and networking constraints.
2. **Cluster Design Blueprint**
   - Define target node count (start with three) and geographic/host distribution strategy.
   - Select and document routing pattern (round-robin via HAProxy/NGINX, or distributed gateway like Lavalink Router).
   - Draft cluster topology diagram outlining bot-to-node traffic, control plane, and metrics pipeline.
3. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Allocate additional hosts or containers with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk) per Lavalink node.
   - Standardize environment variables and secrets management; extend `lavaNodesConfig.js` template to support node arrays with metadata (priority, region).
   - Implement infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Ansible or Compose profiles) to provision nodes reproducibly.
4. **Load Balancer & Service Discovery**
   - Configure load balancer with health checks (REST `/version`, websocket handshake).
   - Define weighted routing so production traffic prefers primary region while keeping secondaries warm.
   - Establish dynamic node registration (e.g., service registry or config store) and refresh cadence for the bot.
5. **Bot Integration Updates**
   - Modify `LavalinkManager` initialization to read multi-node config with adaptive failover rules.
   - Implement node selection policy (least-latency or usage-based) and retry logic on connection drops.
   - Add config toggles for maintenance windows (e.g., disable specific nodes via ENV).
6. **Observability Enhancements**
   - Ship node metrics (CPU, memory, voice connection count, frame loss) to centralized monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana or equivalent).
   - Configure alert rules for node unavailability, high latency, or saturation.
   - Instrument bot logging to capture node assignment per guild session.
7. **Resilience & Chaos Testing**
   - Execute failure drills: terminate nodes, introduce latency, and confirm automatic redistribution.
   - Validate session migration via Lavalink’s player transfer APIs where possible.
8. **Operational Runbook & Automation**
   - Document node lifecycle (add/remove/replace) and emergency procedures.
  - Create scripts for zero-downtime upgrades (e.g., rolling restarts).
9. **Pilot & Rollout**
   - Gradually increase traffic share to new nodes (canary guilds) while monitoring metrics.
   - Iterate based on feedback, then enable cluster for all guilds and decommission reliance on a single node.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Additional compute instances or containers, SSL certificates for secure inter-node communication, load balancer infrastructure, centralized logging/metrics stack.
- **Dependencies:** Existing Docker images and deployment automation, secure secret distribution, potential CI artifacts for Lavalink builds.
- **Stakeholders:** DevOps/Infrastructure engineers (provisioning and load balancing), Backend/bot developers (client integration), QA/Release engineering (validation), Operations/on-call (monitoring and incident response).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: 5–7 engineering days distributed across teams.
  1. Days 1–2: Assessment, design blueprint, and infrastructure provisioning.
  2. Day 3: Load balancer configuration and bot integration adjustments.
  3. Day 4: Observability setup and resilience testing.
  4. Days 5–6: Pilot rollout, feedback incorporation, documentation.
  5. Day 7 (buffer): Final rollout and knowledge transfer.
- Prioritize after container build optimizations (Recommendations E–G) to ensure smaller, quicker node provisioning and before blue-green production rollout to align with multi-environment needs.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Configuration Drift Across Nodes:** Enforce immutable images and centralized config templates; use CI to validate config parity.
- **Increased Latency Due to Load Balancing:** Monitor RTT during pilot; adjust routing strategy or introduce region-aware sharding.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Conduct capacity planning and set autoscaling thresholds where supported.
- **Operational Complexity:** Provide automated scripts and comprehensive runbooks; integrate health checks into CI/CD gates.
- **Security Exposure:** Secure inter-node traffic via TLS and restricted firewalls; rotate credentials via secrets manager.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Functional Testing:** Validate playback across multiple guilds with simulated loads and confirm node distribution.
- **Failover Drills:** Intentionally stop nodes and observe reconnection behavior; run automated scripts to assert RTO targets.
- **Performance Testing:** Stress test cluster with synthetic queue loads to measure latency and throughput.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure bot command suite and existing features operate unchanged under clustered configuration.
- **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Track alert dashboards, review logs for errors, and schedule weekly chaos tests to maintain readiness.
