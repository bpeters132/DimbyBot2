# Implementation Plan: Implement Comprehensive Health Checks

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Introduce robust health checks covering Lavalink connectivity, Discord voice connection state, control channel responsiveness, and supporting infrastructure so issues are detected and remediated quickly.
- Provide automated probes for local development, staging, and production with clear alerting, runbooks, and self-healing hooks.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Deliver health endpoints/commands that verify:
  - Lavalink node reachability and player readiness (< 3 seconds response).
  - Discord voice connection integrity (latency, reconnect success).
  - Control channel/interaction health (message latency, permission checks).
- Achieve detection-to-alert time under 2 minutes for critical outages (Lavalink down, voice connection broken).
- Integrate health checks into CI/CD gating so deployments halt when dependencies fail.
- Reduce unplanned downtime incidents related to Lavalink/voice connectivity by â‰¥50% over next quarter.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Requirements Gathering & Scope Definition**
   - Audit current monitoring gaps in [`src/events/lavaManagerEvents.js`](src/events/lavaManagerEvents.js:1) and [`src/events/lavaNodeEvents.js`](src/events/lavaNodeEvents.js:1).
   - Identify environments (local, staging, prod) and consumers (DevOps, bot maintainers) needing health signals.
   - Define severity levels and notification channels (Discord admin channel, PagerDuty, etc.).

2. **Lavalink Connectivity Probes**
   - Implement periodic REST ping leveraging Lavalink `/version`/`/stats` endpoints (new module `src/util/health/lavalinkProbe.js`).
   - Add WebSocket heartbeat tracker within `LavalinkManager` to detect stale connections; trigger reconnection logic with exponential backoff.
   - Record probe metrics (latency, failure count) and expose via metrics layer (Recommendation X).

3. **Discord Voice Connection Health**
   - Build observer in `src/util/health/voiceConnectionProbe.js` watching `VoiceConnectionStatus` transitions (leveraging `@discordjs/voice` events).
   - On detection of repeated disconnects or `VoiceConnectionStatus.Disconnected` > threshold, attempt self-heal (reconnect / rejoin voice channel) and escalate if unsuccessful.
   - Add instrumentation to log jitter, packet loss (if available) and capture guild IDs impacted.

4. **Application-Level Health Endpoint & Commands**
   - Create lightweight HTTP server or extend existing status endpoint (e.g., `GET /healthz`) returning aggregated status of Lavalink, voice connections, command latency.
   - Add `/health check` slash command for admins to view current state in Discord (with embed detailing each subsystem, last probe timestamp, suggested action).
   - Provide CLI script (`yarn health:check`) for CI/CD to run pre-deploy validations.

5. **Alerting & Automation Hooks**
   - Integrate probes with monitoring stack to emit alerts (Prometheus Alertmanager, Discord webhook).
   - Define runbook: on alert, automatically restart player, reinitialize Lavalink connection, or notify operators depending on failure type.
   - Implement circuit breaker to temporarily route new playback requests to fallback (local player) when Lavalink unhealthy.

6. **Documentation & Runbooks**
   - Produce `docs/suggestions/health-checks-runbook.md` detailing probe logic, alert thresholds, manual remediation steps, and escalation contacts.
   - Update deployment documentation with instructions for enabling health endpoints, environment variable configuration (`HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`, `HEALTH_ALERT_WEBHOOK`).

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** Access to Lavalink REST endpoints, Discord bot admin guild, monitoring/alerting stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager).
- **Dependencies:** Environment configuration system for toggles and credentials, metrics infrastructure (Recommendation X), DevOps pipelines for pre-deploy checks.
- **Stakeholders:** DevOps/SRE (alert routing), Backend developers (probe implementation), QA (failure scenario testing), Community managers (communication of partial outages).

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~5 engineering days including cross-team coordination.
  1. Day 1: Requirements alignment, probe scaffolding, initial Lavalink checks.
  2. Day 2: Voice connection health logic, self-healing paths.
  3. Day 3: `/health` command, HTTP endpoint, CI integration scripts.
  4. Day 4: Monitoring/alert wiring, documentation drafts.
  5. Day 5: Chaos testing, runbook finalization, stakeholder review.
- Prioritize before metrics collection rollout to feed actionable data into dashboards/alerts; align with audio effects feature to watch for resource regressions.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **False Positives Leading to Alert Fatigue:** Calibrate thresholds with staging data and require multiple consecutive failures before triggering critical alerts.
- **Probe-Induced Load or Rate Limits:** Batch checks, respect Lavalink rate limits, and configure probe intervals per environment.
- **Automated Self-Heal Loops:** Implement backoff and maximum retry count; escalate to human after threshold exceeded.
- **Security Exposure of Health Data:** Restrict HTTP endpoint access via token or internal network policy; sanitize outputs to avoid leaking sensitive IDs.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Cover probe modules, status aggregation logic, self-heal decision tree.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate Lavalink outage, network disconnect, and ensure probes detect, retry, and alert appropriately.
- **Chaos Testing:** Intentionally drop Lavalink connection, kill voice adapters in staging, verify alert flow and runbook adherence.
- **CI/CD Validation:** Run `yarn health:check` in pipeline pre-deploy; block deploys when health check fails.
- **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Track alert volume, mean time to detection, and adjust thresholds after first 2 weeks of production usage.
