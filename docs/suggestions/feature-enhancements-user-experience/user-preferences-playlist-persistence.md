# Implementation Plan: Implement User Preferences and Playlist Persistence

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Add infrastructure that allows DimbyBot users to save playback preferences (e.g., default volume, loop mode) and persist playlists across sessions.
- Provide commands and UI flows for creating, listing, updating, and deleting saved playlists and preferences, backed by durable storage.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Persistence layer stores user-scoped settings and playlists with < 1 second average retrieval time.
- Feature parity across guilds: users can access their preferences regardless of server (subject to permissions).
- Acceptance criteria:
  - `/prefs` command to view/update user playback preferences.
  - `/playlist save|load|list|delete` command suite.
  - Data survives bot restarts and deployments.
- Measure adoption by counting unique users saving playlists; target 25% uptake within one month.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. Architectural decision:
   - Select storage solution. Recommend lightweight database (SQLite via Prisma or Knex) or hosted service (Supabase/PostgreSQL) depending on deployment constraints. Document trade-offs in `docs/suggestions/user-preferences-storage-options.md` if further research needed.
   - Define schema: `users`, `preferences`, `playlists`, `playlist_tracks` tables.
2. Infrastructure setup:
   - Add database client initialization in [`BotClient`](src/lib/BotClient.js:1) or dedicated `src/lib/database.js`.
   - Update environment configurations ([`.env.example`](.env.example), `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`) with database credentials and migration commands.
3. Data layer implementation:
   - Create repository modules in `src/db/` (e.g., [`userPreferencesRepository.js`], [`playlistsRepository.js`]) encapsulating CRUD operations.
   - Provide migration scripts (using e.g., Prisma migrate or Knex) with initial schema definitions.
4. Preference management features:
   - Implement `/prefs` slash command under `src/commands/user/` allowing users to set options like default volume, autoplay, loop mode, preferred search source.
   - Modify playback pipeline (e.g., [`handleQueryAndPlay`](src/util/musicManager.js:19)) to apply stored defaults when initializing players.
5. Playlist persistence features:
   - Design command set: `/playlist save <name>`, `/playlist load <name>`, `/playlist list`, `/playlist delete <name>`, `/playlist share <user|public>`.
   - Integrate with queue management so saved playlists map to track identifiers (store Lavalink track info or canonical URLs).
   - Add safeguards for max playlist length and total storage per user.
6. UI/UX enhancements:
   - Update control channel embed to show if current queue originated from a saved playlist (using [`createControlEmbed`](src/events/handlers/handleControlChannel.js:37)).
   - Provide optional ephemeral summaries upon saving/loading playlists.
7. Sharing and guild-scoped preferences (phase 2):
   - Support collaborative playlists with permissions (owner-only edit, shareable via invite code).
   - Allow guild-level defaults (e.g., preferred DJ role) stored separately.
8. Documentation and onboarding:
   - Update [`README.md`](README.md:1) and create end-user guide in `docs/suggestions/playlist-user-guide.md`.
   - Provide migration notes for operators (database setup, backup procedures).
9. Operational readiness:
   - Add database backup and migration steps to CI/CD pipeline.
   - Implement monitoring for query latency and error tracking.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- Dependencies: Discord API for slash commands, Lavalink track identifiers, chosen database SDK.
- Resources: DevOps support for database provisioning, QA for multi-guild testing.
- Stakeholders:
  - Bot maintainers for core code updates.
  - Infrastructure team for database access.
  - Community managers for rollout messaging and feedback collection.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Phase 1 (2–3 weeks): Storage selection, schema implementation, `/prefs` basics.
- Phase 2 (2–3 weeks): Playlist CRUD commands, integration with queue system.
- Phase 3 (optional, 1–2 weeks): Sharing features, advanced analytics, UX polish.
- Align release with a feature flag to allow gradual rollout.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Data consistency issues (e.g., track identifiers invalid over time): store canonical URIs and refresh metadata on load.
- Storage growth: enforce per-user quotas and schedule cleanup of unused playlists.
- Database downtime impacting bot functionality: implement graceful degradation (fall back to defaults, cache most recent preferences).
- Privacy concerns: only store necessary user data (Discord ID) and provide delete requests handling.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- Unit tests for repository modules (CRUD operations, validation).
- Integration tests using in-memory database or test schema to verify command flows.
- Scenario-based QA:
  - Save playlist and load after bot restart.
  - Update preferences and confirm playback behavior adjustments.
  - Test with simultaneous requests across multiple guilds.
- Monitoring: add logging for command usage and error metrics; review after rollout to ensure stability.
