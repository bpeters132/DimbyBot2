# Implementation Plan: Create Development Data Seeding Scripts

## 1. Summary of the Recommendation
- Provide automated scripts that populate the development database with representative data sets (guild metadata, playlists, user preferences) to accelerate feature testing and ensure consistent local/staging environments.
- Integrate seeding into the existing database setup (Recommendation N) with repeatable, idempotent workflows that developers can run on demand or during environment initialization.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics
- Developers can seed a fresh database with baseline data in under two minutes using a single documented command.
- Ensure seed scripts are idempotent, producing consistent results across repeated runs without duplicate records.
- Maintain parity between local development seeds and staging seeds so QA scenarios reproduce accurately (≤5% divergence measured by automated schema comparisons).
- Include seeding validation as part of CI smoke tests to catch drift before merging.

## 3. Technical Approach with Ordered Implementation Tasks
1. **Seed Requirements Definition**
   - Partner with feature owners to identify essential entities: sample guilds, user accounts, playlist entries, queue history, and configuration toggles.
   - Document data sets in `docs/data/seed-requirements.md` (create if necessary) detailing entity counts, relationships, and anonymization rules.

2. **Schema & ORM Alignment**
   - Build on Recommendation N’s ORM choice (e.g., Prisma/Drizzle/Knex) by creating a dedicated seeding module (e.g., `prisma/seed.ts` or `src/db/seed/index.js`).
   - Ensure models expose factories or fixtures (e.g., via `@faker-js/faker`) to generate additional test data when needed.

3. **Script Implementation**
   - Add `yarn db:seed` and `yarn db:reset` commands that respectively populate and wipe/reseed the database. `db:reset` should run migrations down/up followed by seeding.
   - For Docker workflows, extend [`dev-env.sh`](dev-env.sh:1) with `./dev-env.sh db:seed` and `./dev-env.sh db:reset`, mapping to `docker compose` exec commands.
   - Create modular seeding steps (e.g., `seedGuilds`, `seedUsers`, `seedPlaylists`) so contributors can run targeted subsets.

4. **Environment Integration**
   - Update [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](docker-compose.dev.yml:1) to include a one-off `seed` service or documented `docker compose run` command that invokes the seeding script.
   - Wire seeds into onboarding flow: after `./dev-env.sh up`, prompt developers to run `./dev-env.sh db:seed` (or integrate automatically via `.env` toggle).

5. **Staging Usage and CI Hooks**
   - Provide optional staging parameterization by sourcing secrets from environment-specific config (Recommendation O). Example: `yarn db:seed --env=staging`.
   - Add CI job (e.g., `seed-validation`) that runs migrations and seeds in ephemeral database containers to ensure scripts stay functional.

6. **Documentation and Playbooks**
   - Update `README.md` and `docs/suggestions/development-database-setup.md` with seeding instructions, common troubleshooting steps, and reset commands.
   - Create a quick reference chart describing seed modules, sample entities, and known limitations to share with QA and feature teams.

## 4. Required Resources, Dependencies, and Stakeholder Coordination
- **Resources:** ORM/query builder selected in Recommendation N, faker-style libraries, script runner (Node.js), documentation updates.
- **Dependencies:** Completed development database setup, environment-specific configuration loader, automated testing infrastructure to leverage seeded data.
- **Stakeholders:** Backend developers (schema owners), QA team (scenario design), DevOps (CI integration, staging credentials), Documentation maintainers.

## 5. Timeline or Prioritization Notes
- Estimated effort: ~2 engineering days.
  1. Day 1: Requirement gathering, seed schema design, implementation of base scripts.
  2. Day 2 morning: Integration with scripts/compose, CI validation job.
  3. Day 2 afternoon: Documentation, review, and knowledge transfer.
- Execute immediately after Recommendation N (database setup) and before advanced queue visualization work that depends on seeded queues.

## 6. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Becoming Stale:** Schedule quarterly reviews of seed datasets aligned with feature updates; add versioning to seed scripts.
- **Confidential Data Exposure:** Use synthetic data only; ensure no production secrets or user identifiers are included.
- **Schema Changes Breaking Seeds:** Integrate seeding into CI pipeline so migration pull requests fail fast when seeds no longer align.
- **Developer Environments Drifting:** Provide `db:reset` command and document when to run it; consider automatic reset before running integration test suites.

## 7. Testing and Validation Strategy
- **Automated Checks:** Implement unit tests for seed modules ensuring each returns expected counts and relationships (mocking ORM).
- **Local Validation:** Run `yarn db:seed` on clean containers and verify key queries (e.g., playlist count, user-table integrity) succeed.
- **Staging Dry Run:** Execute seeding in staging environment prior to rollout; monitor logs for errors and confirm sample data appears in bot commands.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Add CI job that runs migrations + seeds nightly on ephemeral database to detect drift proactively.
